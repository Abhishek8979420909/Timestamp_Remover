# Timestamp_Remover
<h2> Used Libraries</h2>
<ul>
  <li>tkinter</li>
  <li>regex</li>
</ul>
<p>We used two libraries for this model Firs one is tkinter which used to pop GUI and second one regex which used to find special characters in script</p>
<h2>How this code works </h2>
<p>first we used regex library opeation's to remove timestaps </br>
second we used tkinter library to ask user for input and output in GUI format  </br>
third we used scrolledtext module from tkinter to make GUI scrollable that's it </p>

In this repository we learn how to remove time stamps automatically from a script
